### Selected topic
Predicting the 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD) using demographic and health data 

### Reason for selecting this topic

We selected this data to gain a better understanding of the factors that contribute to the development of coronary heart disease and to explore the potential of using machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of a patient developing CHD in the next 10 years based on their health information.

### Description of the source data

The Framingham Heart Study dataset consists of 4,240 records with 15 attributes, including demographic information such as gender, age, education, smoking behavior, medical history including blood pressure medication, stroke, hypertension, and diabetes, as well as clinical measurements such as cholesterol levels, BMI, heart rate, and glucose levels. This dataset aims to predict the 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) based on the available data.



### Communication Protocols
To ensure effective communication within our team, we have established the following protocols. We will primarily use Slack for all day-to-day communications and updates related to the project. Additionally, we will hold weekly meetings on Sundays to discuss progress, address any issues, and plan for the upcoming week. During these meetings, we will review individual and collective goals and ensure everyone is on the same page. We believe that these communication protocols will help us stay organized, track our progress, and complete the project successfully.
